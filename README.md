# zota-challenge

Repo for Zota Developer Challenge. The directory cmd/cli contains an executable script
that can be used for creating a new deposit with a ```Merchant Order ID```. If the deposit is created
successfully we get the ```Order ID``` generated by the server as well as a link. We can use that link
to finalize the order by following it an choosing a bank transfer as payment method. From that page
we can choose in what end-state we want to finalize the order. 

From the creation of the order until it's finalizaiton the program keeps polling the server for information on 
the status of the order. Once the  order is finalized the polling stops and we get an option to create a new order.
